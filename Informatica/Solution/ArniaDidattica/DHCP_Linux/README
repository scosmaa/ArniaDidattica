DOCUMENTATION

OpenDHCPServerManual.pdf is included in the distro

INSTALLATION

This program if installed on a machine, which is static configured for IP Address,
DNS & router, it detects these settings from server machine (If you want diffrent
setting for clients, edit ini file) and uses them for configuring other machines
on local network.

Expand the gz archive to any directory (say <installDir>)
Change the permissions of file opendhcpd with chmod 711 opendhcpd
For daemonizing, look at section DAEMONIZING below.

test run as root:-
#<installDir>/opendhcpd -v
You should see something similar to:-

Starting DHCP...
Server Name: LinuxServer
Detecting Static Interfaces..
Lease Status URL: http://192.168.33.2
Listening On: 192.168.33.2
Listening On: 192.168.55.2

Now try getting IP Address for another machine, it should work.

RUNNING

This program runs in two modes:-
a) Verbatim Mode (using -v argument)
b) Daemon (not using -v argument)

This program uses 2 or 3 helper files:-
i)   -i[inifile], where configuration settings can be specified,
     default is ./etc/opendhcpd.ini
ii)  -s[statefile] saves current leases, default is /etc/opendhcpd.state 
iii) -l[logfile] dumps log to this file in daemon mode, default is syslog

You can start/run as:-

<installDir>/opendhcpd (daemon with default files)
<installDir>/opendhcpd -v (verbatim with default files)
<installDir>/opendhcpd -i inifile -s statefile -l logfile (as daemon)
<installDir>/opendhcpd -i inifile -s statefile (as daemon)
<installDir>/opendhcpd  -v -i inifile -s statefile as verbatim

Please include %Y for full year or %y for 2 digit year, %m for month, %d for day
of month like:-

<installDir>d/opendhcpd -l <installDir>d/log/opendhcpd%Y%m%d.log -i<installDir>d/opendhcpd.ini

Order of %Y %m %d is not important. You can also include just %m and %Y if you want monthly log file like:-

<installDirecory>/opendhcpd -l <logDirecory>/opendhcpd%Y%m.log -i<someDirecory>/opendhcpd.ini

As shown above if you use separate directory for log file, you should manually create this directory

DAEMONIZING

If your system supports chkconfig command, you can use the enclosed
rc.opendhcp file to add the service. Simply copy rc.opendhcp as
/etc/init.d/opendhcp (or just create a link to it as opendhcpserver in init.d)
and make it executable. Also change the file paths (depending on where you
have installed the executive and log file directory) in this file.
Then you can use chkconfig command to add the daemon.

#ln -s <installDir>/rc.opendhcp /etc/init.d/opendhcp
#chmod 755 /etc/init.d/opendhcp
#chkconfig --add opendhcp
#chkconfig opendhcp on
Thats all you may need.

If you dont have chkconfig command, you can manually modify boot scripts
in /etc/rc.d/rc.local file or /etc/inittab file or /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2
file. Also you need to do following changes:-

Add the enclosed rc.opendhcp script in /etc/rc.d and make it executable (755).
Also change the file paths (depending on where you have installed the executive
and log file directory) in this file. Finally you need to add the lines:-

# Start the Dual DHCP DNS Server daemon:
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.opendhcp ]; then
/etc/rc.d/rc.opendhcp start
fi

to any of above scripts (preferably to /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2)

COMPILING

Recompiling is not generally needed on 32 bit Intel/Linux systems.
For other system, you should. Try:-

#g++ opendhcpd.cpp -oopendhcpd -lpthread
#g++ opendhcpd.cpp -oopendhcpd -lpthread -lgcc_s
#cc opendhcpd.cpp -oopendhcpd -lsocket -lnsl -lpthread

You need C++ compiler for Versions 3 onwards, as these versions use STL
If you have only C Compiler, you need to download and use Version 2.1 only.

CONFIGURATION

1) Configuration of Server

   Server configuration is stored in enclosed opendhcp.ini file, which is self 
   explainatory. At the minimum the Server needs to be specified DHCP Range or Static Clients.
   In the packaged opendhcp.ini file, DHCP Range 192.168.0.1-DHCP Range 192.168.0.254 is 
   specified, for testing, which can be changed.
   
2) Configuration of Clients

   a. You can use windows/linux/unix mix of clients.
   b. The clients should be set to get IP Address automatically.

REPLICATED OPERATION

This is the unique feature of Open DHCP Server that two instances can be simultaneously used. The
database of both servers remains in synch as special DHCP INFORM messages flow between the servers
in unicast mode. When one server renew or allott the lease, other server gets this info and adds the
info in its database. These two servers run on load sharing basis. Now if one server goes down, other
can renew the lease when DHCP REQUEST goes in broadcast mode, without interuption in server.

GENERAL
   
1) This document is for guidance and is covered under GNU public license.

DEBUG

If program is not assigning addresses or resolve them check:-

1) Ensure that you run this program as root only.
2) Check network hardware and ensure that client machines has different host names from server and
   each other.
3) No other service should be running on Server on ports 67.
4) If you get error like port 67 already in use means some other DHCP program or proxy server with DHCP 
   service is running. Use netstat command to detect which program is listening on these ports.
   It is also possible that another copy of opendhcpd itself is running.
5) If you get error Static Interfaces/Listening Ports not available, it may be because of 1) Another
   dhcp Server is running or Interfaces specified on [LISTEN_ON] section are not available.
   or you have just restated the server and TCP port is not yet closed, then wait for some time.
6) Look at log file (if running as service) or Run in standalone mode, it will provide all debug
   information as it verbatim the activities.
7) If you use Braodband router, which also has DHCP Server, this program may still run, but some hosts
   configured by other DHCP Server may not use this DNS Service. Please disable the DHCP Service on
   Broadband router.
8) opendhcpd.state file backs up current leases and is read back when server restarts. If you want to 
   clean previous leases, you may delete this file and restart the server.
9) Errors like "libstdc++.so.?: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" 
   are possible in some Linux flavours. Please recompile the program or create symbolic links:-
	ln -s /usr/local/lib/libstdc++.so.? /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.? 
	ln -s /usr/local/lib/libgcc_s.so.? /usr/lib/libgcc_s.so.?
   (? is library version as reported in error)
   or add the library path (directory where above file is) to env variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
10)If you are not able to receive DHCP Discover messages from clients, make sure that Dual DHCP DNS Server
   and client are on same physical network (not separated by routers). If it is separated by routers and it
   is same subnet, please allow routers to pass broadcast messages to Server on Port 67. If these are 
   different subnets, use the BOOTP relay agents.
11) Make sure that firewall is allowing packets on ports 53 and 67.
12) If you have just upgraded from previous version and program just dies or fails to start, please
    delete /tmp/dualserver.state file and retry.
